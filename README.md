Hello! I am fairly new to programming, but I find it very interesting. 
I spent about 7 months teaching myself a lot of the basics in Javascript
and Python, and I just recently completed my CS 135 course over this last summer.
I am looking forward to becoming apart of this class and the CS culture!
